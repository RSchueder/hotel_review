# hotel_review
A tool to extract the most common positive and negative aspects of hotels based on user reveiws.
The tool also recommends a hotel to you based on what you have responded positively to in the past.

Consists of 2 parts:
* Keyword extraction: For this there is a supervised and an unsupervised technique, relying on TF-IDF + frequency and TF-IDF + random forest respectively.
* Recommender system: For this there are two techniques, one based on cosine similarity of RAKE, and the other on cosine similarity of TF-IDF.
